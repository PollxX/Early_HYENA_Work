Creativity:
We incorporated the Dropbox API along side the usage of threads, which implements runnable, to download and upload directly to the cloud. In addition, we made our own chat concole chat processor to handle the format and multi step process of some commands.  



Examples (key):

[task] and [subtask] is the number seen within the list function
such as: list subtask 1 would result in all the subtask of task 1.

[field] is the search query or entry for data to be manipulated
